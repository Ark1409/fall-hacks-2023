**Project description, how does it tie into the theme?**

The project we are creating today is a habit tracker website. It shows a calendar display and tracks the consistency of the user's habits. This ties to the theme because the theme is “turning over a new leaf”, which means changing behavior for the better. Using a habit tracker can help us develop better habits and improve ourselves.
